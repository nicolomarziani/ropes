# Ropes

Fun for hours: click and drag to create a rope, click drag the ball at the top of a rope to move it, double click a ball to delete a rope. 

## To Be Addressed Immediately

###UI
* Uncomfortable jumping on double-click.
* No ear creation functionality, rope creation baked into several functions it shouldn't be. 
* Ropes must be deleted in the order that they were created (requires hotspot div housekeeping)
