# Ropes

Fun for hours: click and drag to create a rope, click drag the ball at the top of a rope to move it, double click a ball to delete a rope. 

## To Be Addressed Immediately

### UI
* Uncomfortable jumping on double-click.
* No ear creation functionality (ergo no sound), rope creation baked into several functions it shouldn't be. 
* Ropes must be deleted in the reverse order in which they were created (fix requires hotspot div housekeeping).

### Engine
### Audio

## Eventually . . .
* More fun audio: atmospheric noise, two different kinds of ear (pulse and volume), periodic global changes.
* Colors that change over time
* Controls: buttons to switch tones, probably an eraser button (no double-clicking fix in sight). 
* UI overhaul--move away from straight JS.
