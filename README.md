# Ropes

Fun for hours: click the playwindow and drag to create a rope. Click and drag the ball at the top of a rope to move it. Click playwindow without dragging to create an ear. Click and drag an ear to move it. Double-click a rope or an ear to delete it. ~~Click the small black square in the top left corner to change it to red and enter delete mode. Click it again to exit delete mode. When in delete mode, click a rope or an ear to delete it.~~ Double click a rope or an ear to delete it. Click a rope or an ear anf hold for half a second to bring up empty context menu. 

## To Be Addressed Immediately

### UI
* ~~Uncomfortable jumping on double-click.~~
* ~~No ear creation functionality (ergo no sound), rope creation baked into several functions it shouldn't be.~~ 
* ~~Ropes must be deleted in the reverse order in which they were created (fix requires hotspot div housekeeping).~~
* ~~Needs to start looking/feeling better.~~

### Engine
### Audio

## Eventually . . .
* More fun audio: atmospheric noise, two different kinds of ear (pulse and volume), periodic global changes.
* Colors that change over time
* Controls: buttons to switch tones, probably an eraser button ~~(no double-clicking fix in sight)~~ in addition to the perfectly-functioning double-click delete. 
* UI overhaul--move away from straight JS.
