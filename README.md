# Ropes

Fun for hours: click the playwindow and drag to create a rope. Click and drag the ball at the top of a rope to move it. Click playwindow without dragging to create an ear. Click and drag an ear to move it. Double click a rope or an ear to delete it. Click a rope or an ear and hold for half a second to bring up empty context menu. Right click to create a pulse ear.
